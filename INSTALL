Log in into Xubuntu
Open a Terminal
xfce4-settings-manager
Choose AdditionalDrivers 
  => install any missing drivers
Choose LanguageSupport 
  => install missing language support
  => choose RegionalFormats: default configuration is base on current 
     location at time of install but it should be asked during 
     installation (for instance if you are located in a country for 
     which you do not speak the official language, or in a country with
     several official languages and you do not speak the "default" 
     official language). Another weird thing is the default currency 
     based on the country, i.e. currency cannot be set.
Choose Notifications: select theme "Numix"
