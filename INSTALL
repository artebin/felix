Log in into Xubuntu
Open a Terminal
xfce4-settings-manager
Check AdditionalDrivers 
  => install any missing drivers
Choose LanguageSupport 
  => install missing language support
  => choose RegionalFormats: default configuration is base on current 
     location at time of install but it should be asked during 
     installation (for instance if you are located in a country for 
     which you do not speak the official language, or in a country with
     several official languages and you do not speak the "default" 
     official language). Another weird thing is the default currency 
     based on the country, i.e. currency cannot be set.
