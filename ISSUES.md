# ISSUES
- AllTray: when using `alltray -a` and if user types ESC then the window popup is still showed but there is nothing we can do with it except closing it.
- Alltray: when undocking a window, the current virtual workspace changes for being the one of the window at time of docking.
- Caja: the side panel is not working (and the rendering for painting the focuses/unfocused panel is quite ugly).
- Caja: copying files is very slow compared to the command line (local or remote).
- dmenu: for selecting on which monitor to appear, dmenu seems to use the monitor on which the currently focused window is located. It should use the mouse pointer location.
- Geany: markdown plugin is not properly using the css specified (colors are not used and lines starting with the character `#` inside a blockcode are treated as a heading).
