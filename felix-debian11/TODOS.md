- [ ] macbook air: screenshot key => Rofi menu?
- [ ] macbook air: fix the Xmodmap.

- [ ] Check what is missing if we do not use a Power manager (multiple displays support in logind?).
- [ ] Use xdg-open from openbox (no panel no desktop). We can use "dex" but would be good to be able to use xdg-open (gtk-open, exo-open etc. ).

- [ ] Add traces for monitoring the time taken for the installation.

- [ ] <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/378783> 
- [ ] A script at startup of openbox checking for the default application and notify the user about some changes. Have a look at Xfce4 MIME Type Editor.
- [ ] Need a way to do some settings regarding the sensitiviy of the touchpad/mouse a save these settings. The xfce4-mouse-settings is not saved and even worst it is reset during a session but it probably because I use it in a not-XFCE desktop.
- [ ] Test if caja gets unresponsive when the NFS is mounter via a regular mount command rather via gvfs. Just test it by mount it, access it via caja, unplug the network and access it again via caja.
- [ ] Shortcuts for tiling the windows + boxing all the windows on the screen.
- [ ] Read <https://github.com/capn-damo/Openbox-tiling/blob/master/ob-tile.sh>.
- [ ] Add a note for the static route for accessing trevize.net from the local network.

# ISSUES

- [ ] Pasystray: middle click on the tray icon is not muting the sound anymore.
- [ ] GPicView: slow at rendering SVG files.
- [ ] Caja: copying files is very slow compared to the command line (local or remote) => it can be because of GVFS
- [ ] Caja: create new directory with name starting with a dot is bugged.
- [ ] Caja: renaming a .desktop file is bugged.
- [ ] Caja: opening 2 window of file Properties is buggy.
- [ ] Caja: always show the file name (extension are hidden for .desktop files for example) See <https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/issues/727> open ticket.
- [ ] Caja: when opening executable scripts (bash, python) => contextual menu is showing 'open'. Good UX would be 3 menu items: 'Run', 'Run in terminal' and 'Open with X', X being the default application for the mime type. However today there is only 'Open' which will open dialog a popup asking 'Display or run or run in terminal?'. The user does not know what is behind 'Display', display with what??? Even worst: the default application for the mime type is not listed in the 'Open with' maybe because, well... it is the application used for 'Display', erf...
- [ ] dmenu: dmenu appears on the monitor on which the currently focused window is located. It should use the mouse pointer location to determine the monitor.
- [ ] Geany/Markdown: plugin is not properly using the css specified (colors are not used and lines starting with the character `#` inside a blockcode are treated as a heading).
- [ ] Geany/Markdown: when all the document are closed, the Markdown Preview still shows the last preview done.
- [ ] Geany/Markdown: the links are clickable in the preview, if we click one link then the page is showed in the sidebar but there is no way to navigate and go back to the preview.
- [ ] At reboot & shutdown it can still be waiting for the nfs mount points to be unmounted. => it can be because of GVFS, using AutoFS could also be an improvement.
