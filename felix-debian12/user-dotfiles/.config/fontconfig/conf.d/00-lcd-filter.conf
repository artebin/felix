<!-- LCD filter
When using ClearType subpixel rendering, you should enable the LCD 
filter, which is designed to reduce color fringing. This is described 
under LCD filtering in the FreeType 2 API reference. Different options 
are described under FT_LcdFilter, and are illustrated by this LCD 
filter test page.

The lcddefault filter will work for most users. Other filters are 
available that can be used in special situations: lcdlight; a lighter 
filter ideal for fonts that look too bold or fuzzy, lcdlegacy, the 
original Cairo filter; and lcdnone to disable it entirely.
