  <!-- BCI Byte-Code Interpreter
Using BCI hinting, instructions in TrueType fonts are rendered 
according to FreeTypes's interpreter. BCI hinting works well with fonts 
with good hinting instructions. Hinting is enabled by default. I can be 
disabled below.

  <!-- Autohinter
The autohinter attempts to do automatic hinting, disregarding any 
hinting information embedded in the font. Originally, it was the 
default because TrueType2 fonts were patent-protected, but now that 
these patents have expired, there is very little reason to use it. It 
does work better with fonts that have broken or no hinting information, 
but it will be strongly sub-optimal for fonts with good hinting 
information. Generally, common fonts are of the latter kind, so the 
autohinter will not be useful. The autohinter is disabled by default. 
It can be enable below.

  <!-- Hintstyle
Hintstyle is the amount of font reshaping done to line up to the grid. 
Hinting values are: hintnone, hintslight, hintmedium, and hintfull. 
hintslight will make the font more fuzzy to line up to the grid but 
will be better in retaining font shape, while hintfull will 
be a crisp font that aligns well to the pixel grid but will lose a 
greater amount of font shape. hintslight implicitly uses the autohinter 
in a vertical-only mode in favor of font-native information for non-CFF 
(.otf) fonts. hintslight is the default setting. It can be disabled
below.

  <!-- Subpixel layout
Fontconfig will need to know your subpixel layout to be able to display 
your fonts correctly. Use the Subpixel layout monitor test (part of The 
Lagom LCD monitor test pages) to find out your subpixel arrangement.

Subpixel geometry is configured via the rgba property, which could be 
either:
  - rgb — red, green, blue — most common, is used by the most monitors 
    manufactured today.
  - bgr
  - vrgb — vertical
  - vbgr — vertical
