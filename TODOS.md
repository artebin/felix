# TODOS
- [ ] Caja script for indenting XML file
- [ ] Add tree in default package to install.
- [ ] scroll by pixel/pc amount in LibreOffice Calc (rather by number of rows).
- [ ] <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/378783> 
- [ ] Install dex: "DesktopEntry eXecution implements the Freedesktop.org autostart specification, independent of any desktop or window manager environment.". Why xdg-open is not implemented the same way?
- [ ] locate panel-desktop-handler.desktop => this desktop file is called for creating a shortcut for each execution of one desktop file with exo-open, gvfs-open, xdg-open etc.
- [ ] Patch Caja: always show the file name (extension are hidden for .desktop files for example) See <https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/issues/727> open ticket.
- [ ] Use autofs for preventing caja to freeze when NFS/Samba is down or network problems. See <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/267138/preventing-broken-nfs-connection-from-freezing-the-client-system> and <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs>.
- [ ] "mailto" and firefox
- [ ] Add a Caja script for executing a script into a terminal and "press a key" before exit the terminal.
- [ ] It seems thunderbird is not using x-www-browser (chromium is used), "network.protocol-handler.warn-external.http" should be true for all. gnome-www-browser should be set too (not only x-www-browser).
- [ ] A script at startup of openbox checking for the default application and notify the user about some changes.
- [ ] Patch EOM for not showing "set background" is window manager is not Metacity (the WM which should be used with EOM). Use $XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP.
- [ ] Add python-pip
- [ ] Create an install setting using the ubuntu miniso.
- [ ] Fix the Xmodmap for the macbook.
- [ ] Need a way to do some settings regarding the sensitiviy of the touchpad/mouse a save these settings. The xfce4-mouse-settings is not saved and even worst it is reset during a session but it probably because I use it in a not-XFCE desktop.
- [ ] Test if caja gets unresponsive when the NFS is mounter via a regular mount command rather via gvfs. Just test it by mount it, access it via caja, unplug the network and access it again via caja.
- [ ] Fix "N: Ignoring file 'google-chrome.list.bak.180822-101529' in directory '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/' as it has an invalid filename extension"
- [ ] Hibernate is not working anymore.
- [ ] Install dstat from source.
- [ ] Thunderbird config do not mark read automatically.
- [ ] Add recipe for updating the XDG default directory (remove "Templates" and "Music" should be default).
- [ ] Compile from source <https://github.com/freedesktop/xdg-desktop-file-utils> because command "update-desktop-update" is bugged in Ubuntu 18.04.
- [ ] Add pigz and collectd, dstat, atop (+ retrieve systemd service for collectd/dstat from haddock).
- [ ] Shortcuts for tiling the windows + boxing all the windows on the screen.
- [ ] Read <https://github.com/capn-damo/Openbox-tiling/blob/master/ob-tile.sh>.
- [ ] Add shortcuts from openbox in shortcuts.md.
- [ ] Check the configuration of DokuWiki (entities etc.).
- [ ] Add a note for the static route for accessing trevize.net from the local network.

# ISSUES
- AllTray: when using `alltray -a` and if the user types ESC then the window popup is still showed but there is nothing we can do with it except closing it.
- Alltray: when uniconifying a window, the current virtual workspace changes for being the one of the window at time of the iconify.
- Caja: the side panel is not working correctly (and the rendering for painting the focuses/unfocused panel is a little ugly).
- Caja: copying files is very slow compared to the command line (local or remote).
- dmenu: dmenu appears on the monitor on which the currently focused window is located. It should use the mouse pointer location to determine the monitor.
- Geany: markdown plugin is not properly using the css specified (colors are not used and lines starting with the character `#` inside a blockcode are treated as a heading).
- reboot/shutdown can still be waiting for the nfs mount points to be unmounted.
- mtrack does not seem to work with Ubuntu18.04.

# DONE

- [x] Add install for 'psmisc' (not installed by default on Debian)
- [x] SSH Welcome message should not include Ubuntu message.
- [x] Path to JDK should to specified in .xsessionrc (will works on everything Linux distributions).
- [x] Geany default configuration should indent with "tab and space"
- [x] Fix indentation in TODOS.md
- [x] Open "Google Drive" from the menu should create a new Web Browser window, else Drive can be opened in the Web Browser in Desktop#1 but current desktop is Desktop#4.
- [x] Read <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_manager_functionality>
- [x] Read <https://help.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/mime-types-custom.html.en>
- [x] Work with `/etc/mime.types` for setting all text with Geany, all audio/video with VLC.
- [x] Set MIME types using ~/.config/mimeapps.list.
- [x] The fix for the menu border adwaita gtk2 seems to not work anymore.
- [x] mate-power-manager always set to 100pc the keyboard backlight when it starts => did not find the problem, made a quickfix.
- [x] It seems config for geany is missing: side bar, message bar, toolbar only image.
- [x] Clean Openbox rc.xml and add openbox rc.xml v3.4 original for comparison.
- [x] XF86 keys (Explorer, Mail, WWW, Music, Messenger etc.). See <http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/XF86_keyboard_symbols>.
- [x] After some time of inactivity the displays are closed even if VLC is runnning fullscreen => can not replicate it.
- [x] Add a caja script compare which allow 1 or 2 arguments.
- [x] Width of the error zenity popup window => use option `--no-wrap`
- [x] Missing icon for the GUI component "spinner"-like, the '-' icon is an 'x' => use gtk inspector to find the missing icon. It can see the prorblem with obconf. See <http://linux-buddy.blogspot.com/2014/01/gtk-example-spinbutton.html>. See <https://github.com/GNOME/gtk/blob/master/demos/gtk-demo/spinbutton.c>. The problem is `list-remove.png` from Faenza. It could be fixed for all action icon by re-using/modifying the add icon.
- [x] re-add backup alias in bashrc.
- [x] Border for menus in GTK2 with Adwaita, it is quite important because we still have GTK2 application running: Thunar, GVim etc. See <http://www.techytalk.info/fix-clearlooks-gtk-2-theme-missing-menu-borders-on-java-applications/> and <https://azizsaboor.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/fixing-netbeans-menu-display-on-linux-missing-menu-borders-white-on-white-invisible-menu-items/>.
- [x] Add geany shorcut for moving line up/down.
- [x] Invert ctrl+k and ctrl+d? The shortcuts from Eclipse are quite well designed...
- [x] Add some bash function for working with time durations (or use some bc functions).
- [x] Quick tool for rendering chart? => gnu plot and plotdrop GTK GUI.
- [x] VNC with 2 screens => not possible, it is no has no concept of separate monitor, we should set the geometry to support the size of the 2 screens combined.
- [x] Find a search tool with GUI => FSearch seems interesting...
- [x] System monitor: CPU, Memory, I/O, network + add it to openbox menu. => use glances (don't like much mate-system-monitor but keep it installed)
- [x] Use dunst notification (for Translate-Notify especially) => missing dependencies `libxss-dev` and `libxdg-basedir1`
- [x] Caja seems to open MATE terminal (instead of x-terminal-emulator) => property to set in dconf
- [x] Add a `tail and follow` caja script.
- [x] No PulseAudio paman in Xubuntu 18.04 but do I really need it? => I can compile it from the sources, do not know why it is missing in Ubuntu 18.04 repository.

- [x] Disable gnome keyring.
- [x] Use `[Seat:*]` instead of `[Seat:defaults]`
- [x] No Geany Markdown plugin in Xubuntu 18.04 => `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` need to be installed for compiling it and maybe it is not the case when Ubuntu build the geany-plugins package. Fix is: clone the geany-plugin git repo and make/make install the markdown plugin. 
- [x] XDMCP, xrdp and FreeRDP
- [x] Can I set the font size by default in the geany config files?
- [x] Openbox shortcut for minimizing the active window
- [x] Latex install (just install texlive)

- [x] Translate-notify should indicate when the clipboard is empty.
- [x] Rework a little bit the shortcuts `<win>c` should be clip menu, `<win>r` should be dmenu, `<win>z` should be translate notify
- [x] Should I use `--no-install-recommends` with apt? => yes, try with it for next install.
- [x] add CSVKit.
- [x] Add gnumeric, can be useful when LibreOffice crashes (and it happens quite often... ).
- [x] Waiting for window when launching command from dmenu? (and spinning cursor?) => StartNofity was `true` in openbox rc/xml

- [x] Move translate-notify.sh in /usr/bin for being able to start it from dmenu, or add a folder of executables in dmenu.

- [x] Disable recipe for mtrack because it is not working with Ubuntu18.04 (cursor jumps random and no right click).
- [x] How to improve Eclipse UI? It is ugly with Ubuntu 18.04. I was quite happy with Ubuntu 17.04/SWT_GTK3 => it is far better with Adwaita.

- [x] polkit policy file for mate-power-manager and backlight helper is missing.
- [x] Path in Geany desktop file is using "~" which is not supported here.
- [x] Add a function check_package_availability using dpkg/apt => current implementation is using `aptitude search` because can not find relevent return code for `apt` and `dpkg`.
- [x] Is xfce4-volumed really is started via /etc/xdg/autostart/xfce4-volumed.desktop? If yes then we should not start it also from openbox autostart file.
