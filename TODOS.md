# DONE
- [x] Add geany shorcut for moving line up/down.
- [x] Invert ctrl+k and ctrl+d? The shortcuts from Eclipse are quite well designed...
- [x] Add some bash function for working with time durations (or use some bc functions).
- [x] Quick tool for rendering chart? => gnu plot and plotdrop GTK GUI.
- [x] VNC with 2 screens => not possible, it is no has no concept of separate monitor, we should set the geometry to support the size of the 2 screens combined.
- [x] Find a search tool with GUI => FSearch seems interesting...
- [x] System monitor: CPU, Memory, I/O, network + add it to openbox menu. => use glances (don't like much mate-system-monitor but keep it installed)
- [x] Use dunst notification (for Translate-Notify especially) => missing dependencies `libxss-dev` and `libxdg-basedir1`
- [x] Caja seems to open MATE terminal (instead of x-terminal-emulator) => property to set in dconf
- [x] Add a `tail and follow` caja script.
- [x] No PulseAudio paman in Xubuntu 18.04 but do I really need it? => I can compile it from the sources, do not know why it is missing in Ubuntu 18.04 repository.
- [x] Use a Caja script for diff file/directory with meld, see <https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/copy-to-move-to-in-caja/15156/5>
- [x] install.sh should have a log indicating which recipe failed.
- [x] Disable gnome keyring.
- [x] Use `[Seat:*]` instead of `[Seat:defaults]`
- [x] No Geany Markdown plugin in Xubuntu 18.04 => `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` need to be installed for compiling it and maybe it is not the case when Ubuntu build the geany-plugins package. Fix is: clone the geany-plugin git repo and make/make install the markdown plugin. 
- [x] XDMCP, xrdp and FreeRDP
- [x] Can I set the font size by default in the geany config files?
- [x] Openbox shortcut for minimizing the active window
- [x] Latex install (just install texlive)
- [x] Still some colors are not correct with Termite (htop) => openbox `rc.xml` was not correct and was starting htop with mate-terminal instead of termite (but no idea why the colors are not correct with mate-terminal).
- [x] Translate-notify should indicate when the clipboard is empty.
- [x] Rework a little bit the shortcuts `<win>c` should be clip menu, `<win>r` should be dmenu, `<win>z` should be translate notify
- [x] Should I use `--no-install-recommends` with apt? => yes, try with it for next install.
- [x] add CSVKit.
- [x] Add gnumeric, can be useful when LibreOffice crashes (and it happens quite often... ).
- [x] Waiting for window when launching command from dmenu? (and spinning cursor?) => StartNofity was `true` in openbox rc/xml
- [x] Translate feature should allow to type the text, use a dialog for that => use dmenu
- [x] Move translate-notify.sh in /usr/bin for being able to start it from dmenu, or add a folder of executables in dmenu.
- [x] Add `traceroute`.
- [x] Should use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` in particular for geany_one_instance_per_workspace.sh
- [x] How to disable the touch screen on the Dell Inspiron 7000?
- [x] Add configuration file for gsimplecal.
- [x] Switch to Adwaita: (1) Eclipse GUI looks better with Adwaita, (2) bug with Termite scrollbar seems to be fixed with Adwaita, (3) Gsimplecal is better rendered.
- [x] Disable recipe for mtrack because it is not working with Ubuntu18.04 (cursor jumps random and no right click).
- [x] How to improve Eclipse UI? It is ugly with Ubuntu 18.04. I was quite happy with Ubuntu 17.04/SWT_GTK3 => it is far better with Adwaita.
- [x] There is a problem with user recipe configure_gtk, the file `.gtk-bookmarks` does not exists.
- [x] Geany toolbar icon size => better with Adwaita.
- [x] install.sh should stop as soon as a recipe returns an error code.

- [x] If keyboard is properly configured via /etc/default/keyboard then no need to configure it via openbox autostart.
- [x] Clipboard persistence? It is sometimes annoying to see the clipboard is empty after exiting geany but we expected to do a paste somewhere. => install clipit and start it via openbox autostart.
- [x] polkit policy file for mate-power-manager and backlight helper is missing.
- [x] Path in Geany desktop file is using "~" which is not supported here.
- [x] Add a function check_package_availability using dpkg/apt => current implementation is using `aptitude search` because can not find relevent return code for `apt` and `dpkg`.
- [x] Is xfce4-volumed really is started via /etc/xdg/autostart/xfce4-volumed.desktop? If yes then we should not start it also from openbox autostart file.
- [x] Add xfce4-mime-settings in openbox menu
- [x] Example for NFS export => already in the `exports` file installed with the package manager
- [x] Add nfs-kernel-server to the install package list
- [x] Should remove apt.input file

- [x] It can occurs that login after suspend/hibernate, the keyboard configuration is lost. 
- [x] Disable bluetooth at startup

- [x] Add an install bash function (to be used by system, user and specifics, just wait in argument the directory containing the recipes)
- [x] Add should not be run with admin rights (xmodmap in specifics macbook)
- [x] Install other HID implementation allowing the horizontal scroll from the trackpad
- [x] Touchpad is still too much sensitive in macbook air => use mtrack
- [x] Add geany markdown template

- [x] Patch line height for dmenu
- [x] Support NFS/samba + comments in /etc/fstab for how to mount the file systems
