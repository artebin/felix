- 16-09-07: a few apps using GTK3 behave weirdly with mouse scroll, when using a modifier (e.g. super4) + mouse scroll, events for the scrolling are still sent to the app. Example: Synaptic. In my config, I have a shortcut for maximize/unmaximize the window under the mouse, and this shortcut is super + mouse scroll.
