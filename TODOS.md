# ISSUES

- [ ] GPicView: slow at rendering SVG files.
- [ ] Caja: create new directory with name starting with a dot is bugged.
- [ ] Caja: renaming a .desktop file is bugged.
- [ ] Caja: opening 2 window of file Properties is buggy.
- [ ] Caja: always show the file name (extension are hidden for .desktop files for example) See <https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/issues/727> open ticket.
- [ ] Caja: when opening executable scripts (bash, python) => contextual menu is showing 'open'. Good UX would be 3 menu items: 'Run', 'Run in terminal' and 'Open with X', X being the default application for the mime type. However today there is only 'Open' which will open dialog a popup asking 'Display or run or run in terminal?'. The user does not know what is behind 'Display', display with what??? Even worst: the default application for the mime type is not listed in the 'Open with' maybe because, well... it is the application used for 'Display', erf...
- [ ] Geany/Markdown: plugin is not properly using the css specified (colors are not used and lines starting with the character `#` inside a blockcode are treated as a heading).
- [ ] Geany/Markdown: when all the document are closed, the Markdown Preview still shows the last preview done.
- [ ] Geany/Markdown: the links are clickable in the preview, if we click one link then the page is showed in the sidebar but there is no way to navigate and go back to the preview.

- [x] Add a `tail and follow` caja script.
- [x] No PulseAudio paman in Xubuntu 18.04 but do I really need it? => I can compile it from the sources, do not know why it is missing in Ubuntu 18.04 repository.
- [x] Use a Caja script for diff file/directory with meld, see <https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/copy-to-move-to-in-caja/15156/5>

- [x] Disable gnome keyring.
- [x] Use `[Seat:*]` instead of `[Seat:defaults]`
- [x] No Geany Markdown plugin in Xubuntu 18.04 => `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` need to be installed for compiling it and maybe it is not the case when Ubuntu build the geany-plugins package. Fix is: clone the geany-plugin git repo and make/make install the markdown plugin.

- [x] Rework a little bit the shortcuts `<win>c` should be clip menu, `<win>r` should be dmenu, `<win>z` should be translate notify

- [x] add CSVKit.
- [x] Add gnumeric, can be useful when LibreOffice crashes (and it happens quite often... ).

- [x] Move translate-notify.sh in /usr/bin for being able to start it from dmenu, or add a folder of executables in dmenu.

- [x] Disable recipe for mtrack because it is not working with Ubuntu18.04 (cursor jumps random and no right click).
- [x] How to improve Eclipse UI? It is ugly with Ubuntu 18.04. I was quite happy with Ubuntu 17.04/SWT_GTK3 => it is far better with Adwaita.

- [x] If keyboard is properly configured via /etc/default/keyboard then no need to configure it via openbox autostart.
- [x] Clipboard persistence? It is sometimes annoying to see the clipboard is empty after exiting geany but we expected to do a paste somewhere. => install clipit and start it via openbox autostart.
- [x] polkit policy file for mate-power-manager and backlight helper is missing.
- [x] Path in Geany desktop file is using "~" which is not supported here.
- [x] Add a function check_package_availability using dpkg/apt => current implementation is using `aptitude search` because can not find relevent return code for `apt` and `dpkg`.
- [x] Is xfce4-volumed really is started via /etc/xdg/autostart/xfce4-volumed.desktop? If yes then we should not start it also from openbox autostart file.
